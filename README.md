# PyInvaders
## :computer: Info
This is PyInvaders, shorter form of - Space Invaders made with PyGame.<br><br>
It is written in Python with PyGame as the main engine and deployed with pyinstaller<br>

## :hammer: How to build the project
You can use the app without building by going into src/dist and using .exe generated by pyinstaller!<br>
But If you want to build:
- Download PyGame
- Compile the PyInvaders.py file, compiling other ones without it doesn't result in anything
